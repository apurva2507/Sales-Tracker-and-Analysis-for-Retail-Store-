Profit: Tracks the overall profit by subtracting costs from revenue, highlighting the store's profitability.

Profit Ratio: Measures the profitability percentage by dividing profit by total sales, offering insights into the efficiency of revenue generation.

Features of the Project:

Data Visualization: Interactive charts and graphs to present sales trends, profitability, and performance comparisons clearly.

Time-based Analysis: Filters for analyzing data by days, months, or custom time periods to identify trends and patterns.

Drill-down Capabilities: Ability to explore details at the product, category, or region level for deeper analysis.

Actionable Insights: Highlights high-performing and underperforming areas to inform strategic decisions and improvements.

This project demonstrates my ability to design intuitive dashboards, analyze key metrics, and provide meaningful insights to support business growth in the retail sector
